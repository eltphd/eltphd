## 💭 Philosophy

> *Your brilliance is not conditional.*

Building AI systems that recognize and amplify the strengths of people who've been systematically overlooked by standard training distributions.

---

**Currently:** Transitioning from statistical learning to frontier ML research
**Next:** OpenAI Residency 2026 → Interpretable, fair AI for underrepresented populations
**Mission:** Make high-quality research infrastructure accessible to communities who need it most
